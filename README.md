Description:

"Rock Paper Scissors Spock Lizard" is a simple game implemented in Python. 
It is a variation of the classic game "Rock Paper Scissors" with the addition of two extra choices: 
Spock and Lizard. 

The game allows players to compete against the computer in a series of rounds and keeps track of their scores.
The rules of the game are as follows:

Rock crushes Scissors

Scissors cuts Paper

Paper covers Rock

Rock crushes Lizard

Lizard poisons Spock

Spock smashes Scissors

Scissors decapitates Lizard

Lizard eats Paper 

Paper disproves Spock 

Spock vaporizes Rock 


Players can make their choice by typing "rock", "paper", "scissors", "spock", or "lizard" in the console.
The computer will randomly select its choice, and the outcome of each round will be determined based on the rules mentioned above. 
The game continues until a specified number of rounds are played.  
Additionally, this game keeps track of the top 10 players' scores and presents a ranking at the end. 
The score is based on the number of rounds won by each player. 

Note: Please note that the current version of the game does not save new players when the application is closed. 
However, the game functions perfectly in other IDEs and in the executable version. 
This issue is being addressed, and future updates will include the functionality to save players' scores even 
when the application is closed. We apologize for any inconvenience caused and appreciate your understanding. 
In the meantime, you can still enjoy playing the game and challenging yourself to climb the leaderboard within a single session.
